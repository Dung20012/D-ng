        A <b>website</b> (also written as a web site) is one or more <a href="">web pages</a> and related content that is <br>
        identified by a commom <a href="">domain name</a> and published on at least one <a href="">web server.</a> Websites are <br>
        typically dedicated to a particular topic purpose, such as news, education, commerce, <br>
        entertainment, or <a href="">social media. Hyperlinking</a> between web pages guides the navigation of the <br>
        site, which often starts with a <a href="">home page.</a> The <a href="">most-visited</a> sites are <a href="">Google, YouTube,</a> and<br>
        <a href="">Facebook.</a> <br>
        <br>
       
            All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <a href="">World Wide Web.</a> There are also <br>
            private websites that can only be accessed on a <a href="">private netword,</a> such as a company's interrnal<br>
            websites for its employees. <a href="">Users</a> can access websites on a range of devices, including<br>
            <a href="">desktops, laptop, tablets,</a> and <a href="">smartphones.</a> The <a href="">app</a> used on these devices is called a <a href="">web</a><br>
            <a href="">brower.</a>
